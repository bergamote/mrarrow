# Mr. Arrow

Mr. Arrow is a PHP comand line script to generate websites from text files.
It uses the folder structure to generate the website structure and menu.
The text files are then processed trough Markdown and a template php file from the "themes" folder.


## Command

Generate/update the website based on the settings in ./site.conf:
  ./arrow

Same, but when done start the widget (a button to easily update changes):
  ./arrow widget
  

## Settings

The website settings are stored in the site.conf file.
Some examples of the settings which can be defined:

- set the website's name:
    name = My New Website

- set a theme 
    theme = Quiver
  It must be a folder within your "themes" folder.
  If not specified or if the theme doesn't exist, Mr. Arrow will default to ./lib/default_template.php

- respectivly, set in which folder to look for the content files, the theme files and where to export the generated website.
    theme_dir = themes 
    content_dir = content
	  export_dir = export
	(these are the default values if not specified)

You can add your own settings, one per line, following this format:
key = My story
This setting can then be accessed from the php template by calling the $site array.
The folowing would print "My story":
  <?php echo $site['key'] ?>
